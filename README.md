## About

**This is a web application for a boba shop manager to keep track of their supplies of flavor powder.** The manager/user will be able to enter a new supply of flavor powder. The manager will also be able to keep track of the remaining number of servings left for each flavor.

## User Stories

* As the manager, I want to see a list of all available flavor powders. For each flavor, I want to see its flavor, type of flavor, brand, price, weight of purchase and remaining number of servings.
* As the manager, I want to submit a form to add a new supply of flavor powder to a list.
* As the manager, I want to be able to click on a flavor to see its detail page.
* As the manager, I want to see how many servings are left in each flavor. Based on our usage overall, 1 kg (2.2 lbs) of powder is enough to make 50 servings.
* As the manager, I want to be able to click a button next to a flavor whenever I sell a serving of it. This should decrease the number of servings left by 1. 
* As the developer, I want to make sure the remaining number of servings should not be able to go below 0.
* As the developer, I want the application to automatically generate the number of servings based on new supply's weight input.
